      <h2>The animation method anime is made with</h2>
      <p class="desc">
        Cel animation is one of the most traditional forms of animation. It involves parts of the animation (e.g. the
        foreground, the background, characters...)
        being hand-drawn onto clear
        celluloid sheets and layered over each other. The individual sheets are known
        as animation cels.
        Animators create animation sequences by drawing each frame of the animation in such a cell,
        and playing each cell after the other to create a cohesive, moving animation.

      <h2>The most traditional form of animation</h2>
      <p class="desc">
        Stop-motion animation is the oldest form of animation. It involves photos of
        characters/backgrounds being taken in sequence, with characters at slightly
        different positions in each photo. After all the photos are taken, they're assembled together and edited
        into a cohesive video, so the characters in the images appear to be moving as the frames go on.

        3d animation is a style of animation where 3d models made in programs such as maya or blender are "rigged", or
        animated with code.
        This form of animation is used in many movies, such as Up, Rapunzel, Jurassic world....
        To colour the 3d models, 3d animators apply shaders or textures to the 3d models used.
